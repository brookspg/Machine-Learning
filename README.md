# Machine-Learning
Just some machine learning stuff I've fooled around with in python and R. I'll be adding things as I have time to work on them. My goal would be one new implementation a week but we'll see. Most of these aren't optimized and are coded to facilitate understanding of the concepts. There will also be works in progress and ones that are designed for specific purposes but I'll try and keep things general.

Hopefully on the way:
1. Naive Bayes
2. K-means
3. principal component analysis
4. logistic regression
